# AsteroidsGameHu

Welcome to `AsteroidsGameHu`, a modern take on the classic Asteroids arcade game, developed with a keen focus on object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance and polymorphism. This project is a testament to my dedication to crafting engaging gameplay experiences while adhering to clean code practices.

This project is made for COMP2011J course.

## Game Overview

In `AsteroidsGameHu`, Players pilot a spaceship through a field of asteroids, engaging in dogfights with intelligent UFO enemies and collecting power-ups to enhance their ship's capabilities. The game features a variety of levels with increasing difficulty, providing a challenging and immersive experience.

### Design & Features:

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Start with basic asteroid destruction and progress to engaging combat with advanced enemy UFOs.
- **Power-Ups:** Destroying certain asteroids rewards players with bonuses like shields, double bullets, and enhanced thrusters.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Each level increases in difficulty, introducing more hazards and stronger enemies.
- **Intuitive Controls:** Fully keyboard-driven controls for a seamless gaming experience.

## Key Controls

- **Accelerate:** UP arrow
- **Move Left:** LEFT arrow
- **Move Right:** RIGHT arrow
- **Fire:** SPACE bar
- **Hyperspace Jump:** L/R SHIFT
- **Play/Pause:** p

## Technical Highlights

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Leveraged OOP principles to structure game entities and mechanics, promoting code reusability and scalability.
- **Minimalist Aesthetics:** Despite the line-drawn graphics, meticulous attention to design elements like typography and UI ensures a futuristic ambiance and intuitive gameplay.
- **Optimized Performance:** Ensured smooth frame rates and responsive controls, optimizing for an engaging user experience without lags or glitches.
